        <strong><em>Artificial Intelligence</em></strong> has changed the way we live with innovative technologies.
        <strong>AI</strong> has taken a storm in every industry and has a
        profound impact on every sector of society. The term Artificial intelligence terms were <strong>first coined in
            1956</strong> at a conference. The
        discussion of the conference led to interdisciplinary information tech natural language generationnology.
        The advent of the internet helped technology to progress exponentially.
        Artificial intelligence technology was a stand-alone technology thirty years, but now the
        applications are widespread in every sphere of life. Artificial intelligence is known by the AI
        acronym and is the process of <strong>recreating human intelligence in machines</strong>.

        Artificial Intelligence represents computational models of intelligence. Intelligence can be described as
        structures, models, and
        operational functions that can be programmed for problem-solving, inferences, language processing, etc.
        The benefits of using artificial intelligence are already reaped in many sectors.
